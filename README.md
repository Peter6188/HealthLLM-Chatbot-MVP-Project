## Local Deployment/Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peter6188/HealthLLM-Chatbot-MVP-Project.git
   cd HealthLLM-Chatbot-MVP-Project
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv healthllm_env
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source healthllm_env/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   healthllm_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # (To be created based on chosen framework)
   ```

4. **Review Configuration**
   - Review `prompt/system_prompt.md` for chatbot behavior settings
   - Ensure all knowledge base files are present in `knowledge_base/` folder
   - Check documentation for use case requirements

5. **Testing the Chatbot** (Framework dependent)
   ```bash
   # Example commands (will vary based on implementation)
   python main.py                    # For standalone Python implementation
   streamlit run app.py             # For Streamlit web app
   jupyter notebook demo.ipynb      # For Jupyter notebook demo
   ```

### Development Testing
- **Knowledge Base Testing**: Verify all `.md` files in `knowledge_base/` are accessible
- **Prompt Testing**: Test system prompt effectiveness with sample queries
- **Safety Testing**: Ensure red flag symptoms trigger appropriate warnings
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test with various symptom combinations and edge cases

### Deployment Notes
- Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured
- Review medical disclaimers before public deployment
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- Set up proper logging for monitoring and improvement
