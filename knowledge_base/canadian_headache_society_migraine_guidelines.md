# Canadian Headache Society – Migraine Diagnosis & Management Guidelines

## 1. Migraine Prevention (2024 Update)
- Includes new evidence-based strategies and therapies such as gepants, β-blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants  
- Designed to reduce attack frequency and prevent chronification ([migrainecanada.org](https://migrainecanada.org/new-migraine-treatment-guidelines/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1142556-guidelines?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 2. Acute Migraine Treatment (2013)
- **High-quality recommendations**:
  - NSAIDs: Ibuprofen (400 mg), Naproxen sodium (500–825 mg), Diclofenac potassium (50 mg)  
  - Acetaminophen (1000 mg) – optionally with Metoclopramide if nausea is present  
- **Triptans** preferred if NSAIDs/acetaminophen are insufficient  
- Avoid routine use of ergotamine, opioids, and butalbital due to high risk for overuse and adverse effects ([e-lactancia.org](https://www.e-lactancia.org/media/papers/Acute-migraine-guideline-Canadian_2013.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [choosingwiselycanada.org](https://choosingwiselycanada.org/pamphlet/treating-frequent-headaches-with-pain-relievers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 3. Red Flag (“SNOOPPPP”)
- Sudden onset (“worst headache ever”), new onset > 50 years, neurological signs, papilledema, progressive pattern, pregnancy/postpartum, anticoagulants use, etc.
